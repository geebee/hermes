###Description:
Hermes is a small, fast, and simple RESTful log service, which has a pluggable output pipeline for what to do with the messages it recieves.


###How To Run:
 - Prerequisites: node.js (installed)
 - Choose your `output` and `port`:
   1. Run the command: `node ./hermes.js --output stdout --port 8081`


###How To Use:
####Create a log
 - `http://localhost:8081/log` (`POST` - creates a log event, returns `200` on processing success, `400` on validation errors, and `500` on other errors)
 - The log format is not strict in any way. Any structure valid to the chosen output can be `POST`ed
 - Use the following CURL command (or an equivalent) to `POST`: 
	
	    	curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{
    	    	"name":"SomeApp",
    	    	"hostname":"web.server",
    	    	"level":"INFO",
    	    	"time":"2013-04-22T15:10Z",
    	    	"message":"Loggedâ€¦",
    	    	"req":{},
    	    	"v":"0.1"
		    }' http://localhost:8081/log  

####Available outputs:
 - `stdout` - Simply echoes out any message recieved to the server's standard out
   - Validation: _None_
 - `tcp` - Send any message recieved over a TCP socket to a waiting recipient
    - Validation: _Verifies that the message parses as valid JSON_

####Create a new output
 - The `stdout` output contains complete documentation, and enough code to create a functioning output of any type
 - There are very few restrictions, as long as the functions `process` and `validate` are available
 - The `process` function must emit the following events:
   - `received` - emitted at the entry point of the output module
   - `processed` - emitted after the whole output has been processed successfully
   - `error` - emitted if the processing has failed in an unrecoverable way
   - `validationError` if the output's validation format was not met
 - The `validate` function must emit the following events:
   - `validated` - emitted after the validation process has finished
     - The callback data should be `null` if the validation was successful, and contain a `"string"` with the error message if the validation was unsuccessful
